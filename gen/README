* Automatically generate RTL to implement and C code to access AFU control registers.
* Each register is mapped to a unique 32 bit register
* 64 bit registers are supported
* Each register can have a unique reset wire


1. Create spec file format

# comment
register name, number of bits [, reset signal name]


2. Generate code from afu_csr.spec file:

make
